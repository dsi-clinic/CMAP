# 2024-winter-cmap

## Project Background
A comprehensive inventory of stormwater storage and green infrastructure (GI) assets is lacking across northeastern Illinois. Understanding the location of these assets is crucial for ensuring proper maintenance and gaining insights into potential impacts on water quality and stormwater management. An inventory could assist county and municipal stormwater engineers, public works officials, and others in ensuring proper maintenance and inform the development of watershed-based plans and resilience plans.

The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) aims to utilize deep learning to map and identify locations of stormwater storage and related geographic features throughout Chicago and the surrounding area. To initiate the project, CMAP has provided labeled geographic features in Kane County, Illinois (provided by Kane County), to create a predictive deep learning model. This repository contains code to achieve the following objectives:

1. Obtain images corresponding to geographic features across Kane County.
2. Train and test various predictive deep learning models on surrounding geographies.
3. Apply Kane County data to identify stormwater basins in other Illinois counties.

## Project Goals

Several tasks are associated with this project:

1. Improve climate resiliency in northeastern Illinois by utilizing deep learning to map stormwater and green infrastructure from aerial data.
2. Develop deep learning models for aerial imaging data, focusing on green infrastructure and stormwater areas.
3. Train a model to identify different types of locations (e.g., wet ponds, dry-turf bottom, dry-mesic prairie, and constructed wetland detention basins) and then use this model to identify other areas of the region with these attributes.

These goals will be accomplished within the following pipeline structure:
1. Obtain corresponding NAIP images (retrieve_images.py and utils/get_naip_images.py).
2. Utilize a training loop (train.py) with configurations (configs/config.py) assigned to the cluster (.job), utilizing the model defined in utils/model.py and the custom Raster Dataset defined in utils/kc.py.

## Usage


### Environment Set Up 

Before running the repository (see details below), you need to perform the following steps:
1. Install make if you have not already done so.
2. Create and initiate a cmap specific conda environment using the following steps:
    1) Install miniconda:
    ```
    mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
    bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
    ```
    2) Create environment:
    ```
    conda create -y --name cmap python=3.10
    conda activate cmap
    conda install pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
    pip install -r /home/YOUR_USERNAME/2024-winter-cmap/requirements.txt
    ```
### Example of Training in Command Line
Next, you can train the model in an interactive session

```
srun -p general --pty --cpus-per-task=8 --gres=gpu:1 --mem=128GB -t 0-06:00 /bin/bash

conda activate cmap

cd /home/YOUR_USERNAME/2024-winter-cmap

python train.py configs.config [--experiment_name <ExperimentName>] [--aug_type <aug>] [--split <split>] [--num_trial <num_trial>]
```

### Example of Training with Slurm

If you have access to Slurm, you can also train model with it. For more information about how to use Slurm, please look at the information [here](https://github.com/uchicago-dsi/core-facility-docs/blob/main/slurm.md).

This option is best if you know that your code runs and you don't need to test anything with it. 

To run this repo on the Slurm cluster after setting up your conda environment, 

1. Create a file on 2024-winter-cmap called 'submit.sh'. 
2. Copy paste the following into that file, changing YOUR-USERNAME to your username:
```
#!/bin/bash -l
#
#SBATCH --mail-user=YOUR_USERNAME@cs.uchicago.edu
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#SBATCH --output=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/slurm/out/%j.%N.stdout
#SBATCH --error=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/slurm/out/%j.%N.stderr
#SBATCH --chdir=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/slurm
#SBATCH --partition=general
#SBATCH --job-name=cmap
#SBATCH --time=12:00:00
#SBATCH --mem=128GB
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8

source /home/YOUR_USERNAME/miniconda3/bin/activate cmap

export PATH="/home/YOUR_USERNAME/miniconda/bin:$PATH"

cd /home/YOUR_USERNAME/2024-winter-cmap

python train.py configs.config [--experiment_name <ExperimentName>] [--aug_type <aug>] [--split <split>] --num_trial <num_trial>
```
3. To run the file on terminal, type: `sbatch submit.sh`. You can monitor whether your job is running with `squeue`.  

Or, to run in an interactive session:
```
srun -p general --pty --cpus-per-task=8 --gres=gpu:1 --mem=128GB -t 0-06:00 /bin/bash

conda activate cmap

cd /home/YOUR_USERNAME/2024-winter-cmap

python train.py configs.config [--experiment_name <ExperimentName>] [--aug_type <aug>] [--split <split>] [--num_trial <num_trial>]
```
